*Howdy Friend! This project is still in stealthy "friends only mode", meaning I'm sharing it with a few select people to gather initial feedback. Please don't share it with others yet because it is very much only a prototype at the moment.*

*If you want to give me feedback and understand what I'm up to here, start with the documentation link below, which leads to a long [design and architecture document](docs/design/design.md). It describes the rationale and structure of the entire project. But also feel free to browse the codebase. I'm excited to hear from you!*

# Agent OS 
🌞 Build autonomous AI agents!

🛠️The Agent OS is an experimental runtime to construct sophisticated, long-running, self-modifying AI agents. It's designed to interact with large language models and execute functions and code that are generated by them. The OS provides a strongly consistent actor model that is built on a content-addressable storage layer that is inspired by Git. 

❓If you want to understand the motivation behind the project, read the [manifesto](docs/articles/manifesto.md).  
❓To learn how everything works, start reading the [design docs](docs/design/design.md).


## Getting Started
As long as the project is still in alpha, the best way to get started is to clone this repository.

Requires Python >= 3.10 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Once cloned, `cd` into the repository and run:
```
poetry install
```

The project comes with a CLI that can be used to initiate and run agents. To see the available commands run:
```
poetry run aos --help
```

## Your First Agents 🤖 
To run your first agent, put an `.env` file in the project root that contains an OpenAI API key. (It also works without an `.env` file or key if you just want to give the project a quick spin.)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-myspecialkey
```
### Chatbot
Then run the following CLI commands:
```
poetry run aos -d examples/chatbot push
poetry run aos -d examples/chatbot run
```
This 'chatbot' agent comes with a web interface, and the Agent OS hosts a web server. To chat with your agent, browse to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/ag/chatbot/wit/actors/frontend/query/web`

### Coder
Alternatively, if you wish to experiment with a more sophisticated agent that can [generate and execute code](/examples/coder/README.md), you can run the following commands:
```
poetry run aos -d examples/coder push
poetry run aos -d examples/coder run
```
The frontend is available under `http://127.0.0.1:5000/ag/coder/wit/actors/frontend/query/web`

## Project Structure

* `examples/`: examples of agent implementations.
  * `chatbot/`: a simple GTP chatbot. See "Your First Agent" above.
  * `coder/`: an agent that can write, test, and execute code.
* `src/`: contains all relevant modules that are part of the Agent OS.
  * `grit/`: object store, inspired by Git.
  * `wit/`: libraries to help write "wit" state transition functions
  * `runtime/`: the Agent OS runtime: actor executor, custom python module loader, and wit function resolver.
  * `sync/`: modules to push and pull data into grit from the developer's file system.
  * `web/`: the web server that provides the web interface.
  * `cli.py`: the "aos" (agent OS) CLI.
* `tests/`: extensive unit tests that cover most of the `/src` packages 
and modules.
* `docs/`: documentation, intended to be rendered as a GitBook.

## Running the Tests
If you want to hack on the code, it is helpful to run the tests. The project uses `pytest` and has almost 100 unit tests.
```
poetry run pytest tests/
```
